/* Swap positions of successive pairs of values of given array.  If length is odd, do not change the final element.  For [1,2,3,4], return [2,1,4,3].  For example, change input ["Brendan", true, 42] to [true, "Brendan", 42].  As with all array challenges, do this without using any built-in array methods. */
