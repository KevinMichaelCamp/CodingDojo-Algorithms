/* Create a standalone function that accepts two arrays and combines their values sequentially into a new array, at alternating indices starting with the first array.  Extra values from either array should be included afterward.  Given [1,2] and [10,20,30,40], return new array containing [1,10,2,20,30,40].

Second: combine the two arrays' values into the first array, instead of into a new array.  Much more fun!!*/
