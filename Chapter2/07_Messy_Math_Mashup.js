/* Create a function messyMath(num) that will return the following sum: add all integers from 0 up to the given num, except for the following special cases of our count value:

1. If current count (not num) is evenly divisible by 3, don't add to sum; skip to the next count.

2. Otherwise, if current count is evenly divisible by 7, include it twice in sum instead of once.

3. Regardless of the above two cases, if current count is exactly 1/3 of num, return -1 immediately.

Example: If given number is 4, return 7.  If given number is 8, return 34.  If given number is 15, return -1. */
