/* Change is inevitable (especially when breaking a twenty).  Make generateCoinChange(cents).  Accept a number of American cents, compute and print how to represent that amount with smallest number of coins.  Common American coins are pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents), dimes (10 cents), and quarters (25 cents).  After creating code - look to simplify/shorten code.

Example output:
94 cents can be represented by:
  quarters:   3
  dimes:      1
  nickels:    1
  pennies:    4

- Add half-dollar (50 cents) and dollar (100 cents) coins using only 40 additional characters or less. */
