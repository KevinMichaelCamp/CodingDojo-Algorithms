/* Kailin sees beauty in numbers, but also believes that less is more.  Implement sumToOne(num) that sums a given integer's digits repeatedly until the sum is only one digit.  Return that one-digit result.  Example: sumToOne(938) returns 1, because 9 + 2 + 8 = 19, then 1 + 9 = 10, then 1 + 0 = 1. */
