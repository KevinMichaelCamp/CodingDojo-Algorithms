/*Mr Cerise teaches high school math.  Write a function that assigns and prints a letter grade, given an integer representing a score from 0 to 100.  Those getting 90+ get an "A", 80-89 get a "B", 70-79 earn a "C", 60-69 should be "D", and lower than 60 recieve an "F".  For example, given 88, you should log "Score: 88, Grade: B".  Given the score 61, log the string "Score: 68, Grade: D".*/
