/*Stan learned something today: that directly decrementing an array's .length immediately shortens it by that amount.  Given array arr and number x, remove all except the last x elements, and return arr (changed and shorter).  Given ([2,4,6,8,10], 3), change the given array to [6,8,10] and return it.*/
