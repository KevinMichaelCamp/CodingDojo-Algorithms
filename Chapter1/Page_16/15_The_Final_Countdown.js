//This is based on "Flexible Countdown".  The parameter names are not as helpful
//but the problem is essentially identicalf; don't be thrown off!!!
//Given 4 parameters (param1, param2, param3, param4), print the multiples
//of param1, starting at param2 and extending to param3.
//One exeption: if multiple is equal to param4, then skip (don't print) that one.
//Do this using a while loop.
//Example: Given (3,5,17,19), print 6,12,15 (which are all the multiples of 3
//between 5 & 17, except for the value 9).
